# Microarray-Data-Analysis
> This project was based on the paper: "Expression of survivin in lung eosinophils is associated with pathology in a mouse model of allergic asthma"[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19395375]. Using the R packages, I identified differentially expressed genes in three strains of mice from the microarray data of the article.
